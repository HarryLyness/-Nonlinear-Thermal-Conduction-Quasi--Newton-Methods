# -Nonlinear-Thermal-Conduction-Quasi--Newton-Methods
(Masters/PHD, Taken during Y3) Scientific Computing Assignment 1: 92%, 2nd out of 20 in the class

This assignment is about practical aspects of iterative methods for nonlinear systems of the form $F(U)=0$ using newton and quasi-newton type methods

As a motivation, consider nonlinear thermal combustion in a self–heating medium. This problem
arises when investigating critical parameter values for underground repositories of self–heating
waste which are partially covered by buildings. Beyond certain critical parameter values the
steady state solutions may become very large or even unbounded leading to an explosion in the
medium.

The project was based on the results of these mathematical papers
